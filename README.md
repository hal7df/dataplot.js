# dataplot.js

dataplot.js is an in-browser scientific plotting tool, designed to create 
readable, effective, quality graphs with a simple yet powerful user interface.
It is currently still in development, but the planned features are:

  * Import/export data from/to CSV file format
  * Compute and plot trendlines
  * Work on multiple graphs at once
  * Save all data locally (both in the browser's storage and at user-defined locations on the hard drive)
  
You can find the main implementation of dataplot.js [here](https://hal7df.github.io/dataplot.js).
